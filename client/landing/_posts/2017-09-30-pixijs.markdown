description: Talk on Pixi JS
---

It has been a while since I got to do a technical talk at Free Code Camp Toronto. This week's topic was on Pixi.js, a WebGL rendering library.

Although Pixi and the canvas tag is not a very common tool in web development, they are great ways to get an overview of 2D graphics rendering.

Through the talk, I hope to provide a different view on what front-end web development can involve and debunk the notion of front-end is all about layouts.
